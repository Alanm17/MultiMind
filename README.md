# 🚀 MultiMind – A Multi-Agent AI Coding Platform

For the past month, I’ve been building **MultiMind**, an experimental multi-agent AI coding platform where intelligent agents go beyond simple chat — they **collaborate on real codebases**.

## 🧠 Vision

Enable AI agents to autonomously **write, organize, and manage code**, producing production-ready applications from prompt to deployment - like [Same.dev](https://same.dev), but more powerful, extensible, and developer-first.

## 🌐 Focus Areas

- Architecting robust backend systems (APIs, DBs, agent workflows)
- Building AI-powered file and project management
- Enabling real-time collaboration with **Yjs**

## 🔁 System Flow

User ↔ UI ↔ API ↔ AI Agents

This is an early-stage project, but it's already changing how I approach software engineering with AI.
